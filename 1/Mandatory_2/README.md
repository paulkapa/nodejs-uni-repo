# Resources

I know there is room for alot of improvement. I got stuck with some things, found multiple solutions and finally was not able to choose one single approach.

## Startup instructions

### Production

1. Open a console inside the `client` directory and run `npm run build`.
2. Open a console inside the `server` directory and run `npm run start`.

The **server** console will display the (*limited*) live server information and logs, and the **client** console will display the build logs and the build exit code.

### Development

1. Open a console inside the `client` directory and run `npm run dev`.
2. Open a console inside the `server` directory and run `npm run dev`.

Both consoles will display live information about both the **client** and **server** instances, which will also auto-restart individually when changes are detected.
