                Science (from Latin scientia 'knowledge') is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions
                about the universe.

                The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and
                medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical
                world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the
                early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek
                works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific
                Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific was not until the
                19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural
                science."

                Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in
                the
                broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic,
                mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which deal with symbols governed by rules. There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually
                constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence. Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and
                medicine, are described as applied sciences.

            New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems.
            Contemporary scientific
            research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. The practical
            impact of their
            work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products,
            armaments, health care,
            public infrastructure, and environmental protection.
